# Maze Game


## Description
The Maze game has undergone some modifications from its original version, 
introducing four distinct levels with varying maps that progressively increase in difficulty. 
The objective of the game is for players to navigate a ball from the starting area to the exit within a specified time limit. 
Upon successfully completing one level, the subsequent level is unlocked, and this progression continues until all four levels have been conquered or the player fails.

Furthermore, the game incorporates a scoring system based on the time taken to complete each level. 
For instance, players earn two points if they finish within one minute, and one point if it takes longer than one minute. 
However, in the event that a player fails to complete the game due to colliding with the walls, no score is awarded.
